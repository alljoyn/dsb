Features added in Version 15.04a
--------------------------------
* Allow the setting of the UNMARSHAL_TIMEOUT (ASACORE-695). This gives
  applications explicit control over how long unmarshalling waits for new input
  before giving up.
* AJTCL Router Selection (ASACORE-803). TC applications now use the rank
  advertised by the router to select the most desirable router.
* Support for X.509 ECDSA digital certificates, which replace the X.509 RSA
  certificates. (ASACORE-1561)
* AJTCL adds information string to reply messages (ASACORE-1824). This feature
  duplicates the standard library API functionality that allows information to
  be added to a reply message.
* Add support for specifying NVRAM file location on Windows (ASACORE-1835).
* EXPERIMENTAL: UDP Transport for TC <-> RN connections. Thin Client to Routing
  Node version of a UDP-based transport (ASACORE-1404).

Compatibility
-------------
Starting in Version 15.04
* The APIs for About in the core/about_tcl repo are (still) DEPRECATED
* Thin Library protocol version changed from 11 to 12.  Applications that
  require router features of version 12 should set the minimum protocol version
  to 12.
* Support for SPKI certificates for ECDHE_ECDSA was removed; the impact of this
  change is expected to be minimal as it is not believed to have been used.
