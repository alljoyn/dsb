/*
 * This demonstrates AllJoyn.js' capability to reset your
 * devices access point information (SSID, Passphrase) using
 * offboarding. The blinking LED is your devices function
 * and the reset push button is a "network reset" button.
 *
 * Say you get this "blinking" device in your home and you
 * have onboarded it to your home router and it is blinking
 * away as it should. You then change your routers password
 * or SSID and you need to reconfigure the "blinking" device
 * to the new credentials. Since the device is head-less you
 * must have a way to reset these credentials. To do this
 * you call AJ.offboard() which will clear any old SSID
 * credentials and cause the device to go back into Soft AP
 * mode and wait to be onboarded again. Linking this
 * functionality to a button is the most realistic use case
 * since most devices like this always have a reset button.
